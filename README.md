# Go XML Parser

Implementation of an XML Parser using recursive descent. This was a learning project for me and therefore doesn't yet have an application.

## Features

- Parses XML structures.
- Translation to JSON.
- Pretty print AST.
- Semantic Analysis.
- WASM! Runs on the web browser.

## Future Work

I might or might not work on this in the future, I would quite like to add query capabilities, so we could use this to scrape web pages or use it as a test utility.
